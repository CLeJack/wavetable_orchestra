## wavetable_orchestra
This repo contains multiple wavetables created by stripping single cycle waveforms from instruments and placing them in wavetables from lowest to highest frequency.

If these wavetables are used with key tracking applied to the wavetable index, appropriate filter and volume envelopes, and a bit of EQ and reverb, you can get a digital approximation of an acoustic instrument. You can also go in the opposite direction and completely reimagine a sound using envelopes and filters that don't match up with the source instrument, or forego keytracking and use individual cycles as unique digital waveforms.


### File info
Wavetables names typically take the form:
- [Instrument name]\_[Number of semitones]
- [Instrument name]\_[Lowest note]_[Highest note]

These can be used as hints for key tracking.

Wavetable formats include:
- 2048 sample .wav files
- 2048 sample .wt files
